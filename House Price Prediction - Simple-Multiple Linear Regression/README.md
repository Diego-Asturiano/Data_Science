This project involved performing a statistical analysis on home sales data from the Seattle area, covering transactions between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal was to model and predict housing prices as a continuous target variable based on numerical features of the properties. I implemented both simple and multiple linear regression models, evaluated their predictive performance, and compared their accuracy using relevant statistical metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
